I"Ç	<p>This is an audio description of two metal mirrors for a reflecting telescope. One mirror has not been polished, and the other has been polished, ready for use. They are on display here and available to touch, so you can feel the transition from raw material to finished product. They are replicas based on originals made in the 1700s, and have been created using historical materials and techniques. Reflecting telescopes gather light using mirrors. Early telescope mirrors were made from speculum; a type of bronze with an unusually high tin content. Speculum was prized for its shine, although it was brittle and prone to tarnishing.</p>

<p>The polished mirror, and the unfinished example - known as a blank - are both disc-shaped and heavy, each weighing about 4 kilogrammes. They are approximately 14 and a half centimetres wide, and 2 and a half centimetres deep. They are concave, curving inwards - though so slightly it is almost imperceptible â€“ and the sides are gently tapered. A telescope with mirrors of this size would be over two metres long, such as the one William Herschel used to discover the planet Uranus.</p>

<p>The mirror blank, on the left, is covered in rough markings. It has been left unpolished to show how it is after casting. The mirror on the right has been more highly finished. Its surface has been ground by hand with successively finer pastes of sand, before being polished on a soft bed of pitch - or tar - to produce a highly reflective mirror. The mirror polisher was Terry Kubecki Pearce.</p>

<p>Both replicas were cast at Coles Castings in Dorset, using a mould made of sand. Artist Necole Schmitz [NIK-ole (i.e. pronounced the same as if it were spelt â€˜Nicoleâ€™], who prepared the sand mould, explains the casting process:</p>

<p>So today while weâ€™re making the speculum mirrors we start out with a wooden pattern which is a slightly larger version of the final piece and that is packed in a flask â€“ a flask is a kind of cast iron holding vessel for the sand, so the casting sand is packed around the pattern in two halves so that it can be opened up and the pattern can be removed and a sprewing system, a series of channels can be carved into the sand which allows the molten metal to go in to the mould and the gas and air to come out of the other side of the mould. So once this is complete the flask is then put back together and wired shut and then weâ€™re going to melt the metal in the chimney furnace and pour it into the empty mould.</p>
