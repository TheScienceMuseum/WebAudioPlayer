I"¾<p>This is a copy of a trephinated human skull. Youâ€™re welcome to touch and explore the cast. Itâ€™s attached to a dark bronze coloured table with a white top, at a height of 75 centimetres.</p>

<p>The display backs onto a dark grey balcony pillar. To hear the description, position yourself so that the copy of the skull is to the right, with large print and Braille labels to the left.</p>

<p>The copy that youâ€™re handling is a yellowish white colour, resembling bone â€“ though the texture is different. It has been mounted on five rods. The copy was made from a real skull that is on display in the glass cabinet to your left. Over two thousand years ago, this person underwent trephination â€“ surgery to drill holes into the skull.</p>

<p>You can feel three of these holes grouped closely together: theyâ€™re on the top of the head and to the left as you face the skull. In the original skull, these holes penetrate right through the bone; but in the copy weâ€™ve made them shallower to avoid small fingers getting trapped. At the front of the skull, above the centre of the forehead, is a fourth large indentation.</p>

<p>We donâ€™t know what this last indentation is â€“ nor why this person underwent the operation. It may have been to help treat headaches, to release spirits thought to be responsible for ill-health, or possibly for ritual purposes. But we do know that they survived for some time afterwards, because the holes in their skull show signs of healing. This was against incredible odds. Pain relief and protection against infection was limited to a few plants such as coca leaves, so not many people survived the operation.  Modern-day surgeons do a similar procedure to gain access to the brain or to relieve pressure; but theyâ€™re working in a sterile operating theatre, using general anaesthesia, and with ways to prevent infection.</p>

<p>As you explore the whole skull, youâ€™ll notice that some of the teeth are missing, as well as some small bones in the nose and eye areas. Again, we donâ€™t know why.<br />
The original skull from which this copy was taken is displayed in the glass cabinet immediately to the left. The skull was found in 1958, in a tomb in Jericho, in the valley of Jordan.</p>
