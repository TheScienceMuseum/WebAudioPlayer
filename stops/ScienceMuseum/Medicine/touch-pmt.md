## Touch object: Post-mortem tools

This is a display of two metal post-mortem tools – a skull chisel and rib shears –
which you’re welcome to touch and explore.
They’re placed side by side on a white table top, at a height of 75 centimetres.  

This is a freestanding display, so the objects can be viewed in the round.
But to hear the description, position yourself so that the tools are in
the right-hand half of the table. Large print and Braille labels are to the left.

The two tools have been attached to the top of the table so you won’t be
able to pick them up – but you can explore their upper surfaces.  

Pathologists use these tools to cut through bone during a post-mortem.
Unlike the other touch objects in the galleries, which are models or replicas,
these two pieces are modern-day pathologists’ tools. They’re made of shiny stainless steel.
As you handle them, you’ll be aware that – though they were designed to be cutting tools –
they’ve been filed down now so there are no sharp edges.  

The tool on the left is shaped like a capital T. This is a skull chisel.
The cross bar at the top is the handle; from the centre of the handle,
the long blade extends to a curved edge at the bottom. Pathologists use
the chisel to help them access the brain. After the top of the skull has
been sawn in two, the chisel is used to gently separate the parts
of the skull, to expose the brain.

On the right is a pair of rib shears. Working your way from bottom to top,
you can feel the pair of long handles, with their ridged surface. Towards the top,
the two handles join, before curving round to the left to form the head of the shears.
The pivot provides the extra force to allow the shears to cut through bone.
The shears are fixed closed, but you can run your finger along the
serrated edge where the two blades join. Pathologists use the rib shears to open
the ribcage to allow examination of organs inside the chest.  

These two tools were donated by the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford,
who also donated other pathology instruments for the display in this section.
